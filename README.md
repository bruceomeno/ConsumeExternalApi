# Consume External API

## This is an example of how to consume an external API in Java.

Here we are going to fetch a list of users from This [Endpoint](https://mocki.io/v1/d4867d8b-b5d5-4a48-a4ab-79131b5809b8) and check if a user exists.
If a user exists we return 1 and if the user does not exist we return -1.
